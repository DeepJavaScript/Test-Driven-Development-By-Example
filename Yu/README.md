## Ch 1 Chapter 1. Multi-Currency Money

Before reading chapter 1, I skip the `Introduction` section and I feel pity. I was like what are we doing here? after reading the first paragraph of chapter 1. Also, I really like the rhythm in Part I, especially the `small and ugly`, I just can not agree more. Chapter 1, most likely was a tour of how this book is structured. it brings us to the phase of writing the very first test case. Discussed how be prepare a fail test case, and how can we do the ugly change to make it pass. Moreover, we need patience to spot the Duplication and refactor it before jumping to the next todos.

I feel surprised that Kent trate the copy of data as duplication.

And I am convinced that TDD is `being able to take teeny-tiny steps`. in other words, flexibility.
