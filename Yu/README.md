## Chapter 1. Multi-Currency Money

Before reading chapter 1, I skip the `Introduction` section and I feel pity. I was like what are we doing here? after reading the first paragraph of chapter 1. Also, I really like the rhythm in Part I, especially the `small and ugly`, I just can not agree more. Chapter 1, most likely was a tour of how this book is structured. it brings us to the phase of writing the very first test case. Discussed how be prepare a fail test case, and how can we do the ugly change to make it pass. Moreover, we need the patience to spot the Duplication and refactor it before jumping to the next todos.

I feel surprised that Kent treat the copy of data as duplication.

And I am convinced that TDD is `being able to take teeny-tiny steps`. in other words, flexibility. 

## Chapter 4. Privacy

- [x] Used functionality just developed to improve a test
- [x] Noticed that if two tests fail at once we're sunk 
- [x] Proceeded in spite of the risk
- [x] Used new functionality in the object under test to reduce coupling between the tests and the code
